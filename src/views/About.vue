    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p class="p-content">
      I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer based out of Eastern Idaho. <br />
      Growing up in the PNW, I called Seattle my home, but once I graduated High School <br />
      I went on to Brigham Young University - Idaho in the small town of Rexburg, Idaho. <br /><br /><br />
      In the tail end of 2018 I finished serving my 2 year Service Mission for the LDS <br />
      Church in Nicaragua and the Tempe, Arizona area. I then began my journey to <br />
      obtain my Bachelors Degree in Software Engineering. <br /><br /><br />
      I will be graduating in December of 2021, and am searching for Full-time employment opportunities. <br />
